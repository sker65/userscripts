# Enhance OWA userscript
include this user script to add some enhancements to Outlook Web Access (OWA)

I build it as we switched to OWA in out company recently and I realized there was no good support for online meetings.

Maybe this is also due to the fact of the OWA version we use, but anyway it was some javascript / tempermonkey exercise :-)
